# Application-of-machine-learning-techniques-for-supply-chain-demand-forecasting

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for supply chain demand forecasting, focusing on the bullwhip effectâ€”a phenomenon where demand distortions amplify as they move up the supply chain. The study compares traditional forecasting methods (e.g., Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) with advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) using two datasets: one simulated and one based on real transactional sales data.

**Key Findings:**

**Traditional Methods:** Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) performed best among traditional models.

**Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperformed other methods, providing the most accurate forecasts for real-world data.

**Simulated Data:** Traditional methods like EWMA and ARIMA performed well, with machine learning models showing only slight improvements.

**Real Data:** Advanced machine learning techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) significantly improved forecasting accuracy compared to traditional methods.

**Worst Performers:** Naive Forecast and Moving Average had the highest error rates across both datasets.
